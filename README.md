# Boxnovel

A web scrapping application developed using php.
Note: The coding structure is messy since I focused on the functionality only.

# What I Learned

- Scraped contents from a website by using curl.
- Filtered out the required content from curl by using regular expressions.
- More filters using php explode function.
- Refactoring codes to make it easier to manage and maintain.
